# Qliro One Checkout for Magento 2

(Versions starting from 1.4.0 verified in Magento 2.4.6)

The module is a fully functional implementation of a custom checkout that uses Qliro One functionality through its API.

Out of the box, only purchase of virtual, simple and configurable Magento products are supported, but there is a
built-in mechanism for extending support for custom product types, custom shipping methods, custom discounts, provided
within the code of the module.

## System configuration options

As Qliro One Checkout is designed as a custom payment method, all configuration options are located in admin panel,
under **STORES > Settings > Configuration > SALES > Payment Methods > Qliro One Checkout**.

- **Enabled** — must be set to "Yes" for specific website, to turn on Qliro One Checkout functionality.
  Note that Qliro One checkout replaces the standard Magento One Page Checkout for that website, they cannot be
  used together at the same time.
- **Title** — a store-specific name of Qliro One checkout, visible as a title on the checkout page, as well as used
  in order management to represent Qliro One payment method.
- **Debug Mode** — a website-specific flag that indicates debugging mode. In debugging mode, the logging is very
  detailed, but debug mode must only be used for troubleshooting or during development, otherwise website will be
  easily overflown with extensive logged information.
- **Eager Checkout Refreshes** - If enabled, the lock and unlock of the Qliro One checkout is skipped. It also skips 
  the refresh of checkout when an update is made in the Iframe. Enabling this is not encouraged!

  shipping address.
